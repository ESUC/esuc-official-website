			Greetings! Iâ€™m Chris! I transferred to UCLA in Fall 2013 from a community college in the East Bay Area (Los Medanos College). Throughout my academic career, I changed my major 8 times, until (finally) I realized computer science best fit my interests. Fundamentally, I am drawn to creation, to taking an idea and making it reality. This attraction to creation motivates my pursuits as a musician and mobile app developer. While at UCLA, I hope to gain the skills needed to successfully redefine the role of technology in the classroom. I love learning new things and always enjoy talking about ideas, technology, and the future of education.
